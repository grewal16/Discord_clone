## âš¡ Quick Start Guide

To get this Discord Clone running locally or to inspect its codebase, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Discord_clone.git
    cd Discord_clone
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server (Optional, for dynamic rebuilding):**
    If a `vite` development server is configured (common for projects with `node_modules/vite`):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
    Alternatively, for a static preview, simply open `index.html` in your browser.

4.  **Build for production (Optional):**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or yarn build
    ```
    This will generate optimized static assets in a `dist/` folder (or similar, depending on Vite configuration).
